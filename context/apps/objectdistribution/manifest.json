    "short": "Here's what I've been playing with for distributing objects on a terrain. I meant to make a full terrain generator but there's too much to focus on rn, so it seems better here for everyone to share. You need to set the name of your template (Oak in the example) and the tag of your terrain (in this example I have a script on the terrain that simply tags it). Could be easier to use for sure but you can really create some nice looking environments fairly quickly if you have the assets. Sorry for the poor video quality, had to compress to be able to upload.",
