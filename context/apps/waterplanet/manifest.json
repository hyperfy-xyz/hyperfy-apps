    "short": "Hey Vox, I used \"answer to this message\" for the ref, sorry , don't wan't to bother you. \nMessage for anyone who can help: \nI tried to copy the SAMPLE script in WaterPlanet (name updated in the script).  WaterPlanet has been created with Hyperfy Tool in Blender , is there a way to adapt the script for the hierarchy created by the addon (hyperfy tool) ?  Or I need to do differently (like glb with custom properties maybe?) to have water moving and keeping the collision ? Also , if we add a planet ring, can all moves be managed in script (water move, ring move,etc..) if it's exported as Batch GLB with Hyperfy Tool?",
